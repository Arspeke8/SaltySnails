# Salty Snails

## Description

- This website allows users to get information about our environment and different things they can do to help save our environment.
- Users can sign up for email updates, look for charities near them, and search for a city's air quality.
- User can also create and keep track of a checklist of items they can do to help our environment.
- This project helped us to learn how to use Bulma as a CSS framework and implement server-side APIs in our own webpage.
