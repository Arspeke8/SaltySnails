      <p>
        The life that we lead and the lifestyle choices that we make heavily
        depend on where we are in the world, more specifically the environment
        in which we live. It provides resources used to build homes and keep us
        warm, resources to power our cars or start fires that keep us warm at
        night. All of these things are incredibly important and most of which we
        rely on heavily every day. Beyond what it has to offer The environment
        is important beyond just life for us it supports animals, bugs and
        plants. That is just one of the many reasons that it is vital we take
        care of it. Today the world is facing a problem of overuse and abuse of
        nature and all that it has to offer leads to very damaging situations
        for its inhabitants including us! That is just one of the many reasons
        it is of absolute importance that we take care of the places in which we
        live and the impact we leave on the world around us. Many in recent
        years have stepped up to try and help preserve and protect the
        environment such as Salty The Snail! However Salty and many out there
        just like him need your help!
